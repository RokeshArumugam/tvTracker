TV Tracker is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that I created to keep track of how many episodes I've watched of each TV show.

This project is nowhere near finished and was simply an experiment for me to see how PWAs work. PWAs seem like a way to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and make mobile apps for IOS and Android. I only spent a weekend on this but may come back to it in the future.


## Background

I was looking into making cross-platform mobile apps and came across something called PWAs (Progressive Web Apps). They are essentially websites that can be added to your device's homescreen like a bookmark, but, unlike normal websites, they will open and function similar to an app rather than a webpage in the browser.

I had (and still have) a note on my phone about the TV shows I'm watching or have been recommended by my friends. I thought it would be much more efficient to have a dedicated app to track this, and hence, combined with my fascination with PWAs, this project was born.
